# EmployeeManagementSystem

Himalaya Organic Farm is an agro-industrial corporation with vast plantations and factories in the north of Nepal. With its huge labor force its human resources department formerly had a flat file system for handling employee information. This wasn’t quite good as it couldn’t meet up with the ever changing needs of the corporation. The aim of this project is to build a system whereby Himalaya Organic Farm can safely keep and manage employee information. It is to act a source of knowledge for strategic decision making by Himalaya Organic Farm management and other external agencies connected to the corporation. The following are the requirements of the software for managing the Employee Management System.

This system is used by two users Admin and Employee.
